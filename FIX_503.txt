✅ 503 ERROR FIXED - READY TO DEPLOY

WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?
======================
Your Hostinger configuration was looking for "server.js" in the root directory,
but your app structure had the backend in a "backend/" subdirectory.

WHAT WAS FIXED?
===============
1. Created server.js in root directory - This is the entry point Hostinger expects
2. Updated package.json - Auto-installs backend dependencies during deployment
3. Fixed CSP headers - Allows JavaScript execution (was blocking with 'unsafe-eval' error)
4. Added automatic database initialization - Will create database on first run

DEPLOY STEPS (DO THIS NOW):
===========================

Your code is already pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/phizteck-cpu/global

1. GO TO HOSTINGER CONTROL PANEL
   - Your app should auto-deploy from GitHub
   - OR click "Deploy" button manually
   - Wait for build to complete

2. AFTER DEPLOYMENT, SSH INTO SERVER (CRITICAL STEP):
   
   ssh your-username@your-server
   cd domains/api2.valuehills.shop/public_html/backend
   npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
   npm run seed
   pm2 restart all

   (This creates the database and admin user)

3. TEST YOUR API:
   
   Open in browser:
   - https://api2.valuehills.shop/api/health
   - https://api2.valuehills.shop/
   - https://api2.valuehills.shop/debug/db
   
   All should return JSON (no 503 error!)

4. LOGIN AS ADMIN:
   
   Username: superadmin
   Password: Admin@123

THAT'S IT! Your backend should now work without 503 errors.

NEED HELP?
==========
- Check HOSTINGER_SETUP_COMPLETE.md for detailed troubleshooting
- Check DEPLOY_NOW.md for quick reference commands
- View Hostinger application logs if errors persist

The main fix was creating server.js that Hostinger can find and run!
